## A Theoretical Framework for Information Storage and Processing in Light-Based Topological Structures

## Abstract

Conventional photonic computing faces a fundamental challenge: light wants to propagate, not stay. This document proposes an alternative approach derived from the Reciprocal System of physical theory (Larson, 1959; Peret, 2015) and Goethean phenomenology of light (Goethe, 1810; Vijaya, 2020): rather than storing light, we store *darkness*—stable topological structures (phase singularities, vortices) defined by their boundaries.

**The hole is the data.**

The framework synthesizes four domains:
1. **Goethean light science** — treating darkness as a positive polar principle
2. **RS2 dimensional algebra** — mapping physical structures to division algebras
3. **Photon Bose-Einstein condensation physics** — room-temperature coherence mechanisms
4. **Biological validation** — DNA as existence proof for photonic storage

---

## Key Claims

- Information in photonic systems can be stored in the topology of *absence*, not in the presence of light
- The transition from propagating light to stored information is a true thermodynamic phase transition
- DNA demonstrates room-temperature photonic storage using precisely this mechanism
- Projected storage densities: ~10¹⁵-10¹⁹ bits/cm³ (approaching DNA's ~10¹⁹ bits/cm³)
